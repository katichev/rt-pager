View a remote text file via SSH

This small utility allows to get a remote file contents via SSH. It uses *NIX 'less' to open a file. A simple virtual terminal emulator is used to drive 'less' and capture viewport.

This might be useful if you need to quickly look through a huge remote log without actually downloading it.
